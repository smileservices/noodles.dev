                <h3>Why Noodles?</h3>
                <p>We know how difficult is to learn software engineering.
                    It's a steep learning curve and the threshold required for getting a job in the industry is pretty
                    high.
                    Therefore, many students have to live economically and eat the cheapest food there is: instant
                    noodles!
                    <br>
                    We believe that noodles is a symbol for the empowered student that fights through messy lines of
                    code and confusing bugs. Never loose hope!
                    That's why we have noodles here.
