                            <p><strong>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</strong><em>We aim to protect your personal
                                information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
                            <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed
                                to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our
                                safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
                                Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
                                cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
                                parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal,
                                or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
                                information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own
                                risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.</p>

                                collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
                                implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT

                                to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow
                                in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
